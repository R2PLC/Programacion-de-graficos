My best codes as a student

Here is an excerpt from all my work in the university's graphics programming course, one that made me pull my hair out and almost made me cry. But I did it.

Here you'll find all the programs from five assignments, as well as the programs that caught my attention the most from eight practices. To achieve this, knowledge of mathematics, physics, and programming was used. Everything (or almost everything) was done in C with glut libraries.

They took me a long time, and even made me frustrated, and maybe the result wasn't perfect, but it helped me realize that with effort and help, things can be accomplished. I never thought I would be able to program all of this. The course was a very good introduction to the field of 3D animation (which was what I originally wanted to study instead of engineering). I was surprised by all the physics and mathematics knowledge one must have to do this.

I am very happy with what I've learned. When I compare the first assignment, where I didn't get anything, to the last practice where I achieved everything, I realize my progress, and I feel proud. I may not be the best programmer or anything, but I've improved, and the ability to improve is more important to me than doing everything perfectly, and that is the biggest lesson for me in these programs.
